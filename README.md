# IOS Developer Tech Test

## favorite_programming_language_poll_tech_test

Thank you for your interest in the iOS Developer position at SIDEARM Sports! 

## We would love to see your iOS/Swift knowledge in action.

This repo contains a blank XCode project for a starting point. Design is up to you! Please create a simple IOS application that achieves the requirements below:

- The app should be a single screen that contains a 3 question poll. 
- It should have the question "What is your favorite programming language?" 
- It should have the following choices:
    - Swift
    - Java
    - Kotlin

There should be a button to submit your answer. Below that, there should be another button that pops up a modal window that displays number of votes for each choice.

Please create your own repository and send us the link to review, we look forward to seeing what you come up with!

**Turnaround Time**: It is understood that you want to put your best foot forward, but we also understand that you have other responsibilities. Our intention with this tech test is that you should be able to deliver an application you are happy with by spending no more than a couple of hours per night over a couple of nights.

## What Comes Next: 

If we like what we see, we will bring you back in to go over your code.
